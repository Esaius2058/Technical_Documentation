        <h4>Restaurant Management System</h4>
        <p>This restaurant management system can be used by employees in a restaurant to handle the clients, their orders and can help them easily find free tables. The restaurant menu is organized by categories (appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, sides and drinks) of menu items. Each menu item has a name, price and associated recipe. A recipe for a menu item has a chef, preparation instructions and associated ingredients.</p>
        <p>Restaurant management system is the system for manage the restaurant business. Restaurant management can vary across multiple management styles, however, there is always one common
denominator when it comes to setting goals: maximizing a restaurant’s profitability. In order to maximize a restaurant’s profitability, one has to always examine and understand a restaurant’s operational costs and how these relate to a restaurant’s productivity and efficiency in delivering
quality service to its customers. Management takes a very important role in controlling and manipulating the balance of costs and profitability. An effective manager must always concern himself/herself with restaurant issues that pertain to inventory/stocking, pricing, order-taking, and
much more. Oftentimes, a restaurant’s profitability eithe
r rises or falls depending on how well it is being managed.</p>
        <p>Managing a restaurant using a well-developed software minimizes the liabilities of mismanagement and productivity loopholes. The incorporation of a Restaurant Management Software in the managing of various business processes entails that your restaurant is competitive, innovative, well-managed, and up-to-date with the latest management and business trends.</p>

        <header>Scope of project</header>
        <p>Scope of project in building a computerized system for silk route to handle billing restaurant records was to include the employees who are involved in the process of billing of a customer to storage of restaurant records and enables to view the records as desired. The employees are given limited access in order to safe guard the privacy and security of the records. The database is maintained in the whole project.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="objectives">
        <header>Objectives</header>
        <ul>The main objective is to maximize the profit by increasing efficient and decreasing the mistakes that takes place in the kitchen, this will be done without compromising customer satisfaction. At this moment of time, there are still numerous restaurants that still use paper based system to get messages across between the restaurant and the kitchen, this way of communication is one of the least efficient method. However, this approach may be implemented and designed in a successful  profitable restaurant but there are numerous problems which might be seen as reducing the restaurants efficiency, they are the following:
        <li>The lack of communication that is caused by handwriting.</li>
        <li>Uncontrolled order logging (poor order taking).</li>
        <li>Unproductive communication between restaurant and kitchen.</li>
        <li>Faults with order taking and lack of time management.</li>
        <li>Lack of good quality stock management.</li>
        <li>Limited statistical output.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, in order to overcome these problems, we have made an application that is restaurant management system that mainly focuses on the above given problems. We have tried to build a user-friendly interface.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="process_model_to_be_used">
        <header>Process Model to be used</header>
        <p>The process model we have used here is iterative model. The iterative model is a particular implementation of a software development life cycle (SDLC) that focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, which then progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the final system is complete. When discussing the iterative method, the concept of incremental development will also often be used liberally and interchangeably, which describes the incremental alterations made during the design and implementation of each new iteration.</p>
        <p>Unlike the more traditional waterfall model, which focuses on a stringent step-by-step process of development stages, the iterative model is best thought of as a cyclical process. The requirements of our project can be accomplished through iterative model.
 </p>
        <ul> Phases to be covered in iterative model for Restaurant Management System:
          <li><strong>Planning & Requirements: </strong>
As with most any development project, the first step is go through an initial planning stage to map out the specification documents, establish software or hardware requirements, and generally prepare for the upcoming stages of the cycle.
 </li>
          <li><strong> Analysis & Design
: </strong>Once planning is complete, an analysis is performed to nail down the appropriate business logic, database models, and the like that will be required at this stage in the project. The design stage also occurs here, establishing any technical requirements (languages, data layers, services, etc) that will be utilized in order to meet the needs of the analysis stage.</li>
</ul>
      <li><strong>Implementation: </strong> With the planning and analysis out of the way, the actual implementation and coding process can now begin. All planning, specification, and design docs up to this  point are coded and implemented into this initial iteration of the project.
</li>
      <li><strong>Testing: </strong> Once this current build iteration has been coded and implemented, the next step is to go through a series of testing procedures to identify and locate any potential bugs or issues that have cropped up.
</li>
      <li><strong> Evaluation
: </strong>Once all prior stages have been completed, it is time for a thorough evaluation of development up to this stage. This allows the entire team, as well as clients or other outside parties, to examine where the project is at, where it needs to be, what can or should change, and so on.</li>

        <header>Testing Strategy</header>
        <p>In computer hardware and software development, testing is used at key checkpoints in the overall  process to determine whether objectives are being met. For example, in software development,  product objectives are sometimes tested by product user representatives. Software testing is very important because of the following reasons: Software testing is really required to point out the defects and errors that were made during the development phases. It's essential since it makes sure of the customer reliability and their satisfaction in the application.</p>

        <ol><li><h5>Limitations of the periodic system.</h5>
        <p>With the periodic system, the company knows the inventory level with certainty only when it  physically counts the inventory at the end of each period. Throughout the period, the company takes customer orders without knowing the exact inventory count or whether enough products are available to meet customer demand.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Limited connection.</h5><p>With the periodic system, the company knows the inventory level with certainty only when it  physically counts the inventory at the end of each period. Throughout the period, the company takes customer orders without knowing the exact inventory count or whether enough products are available to meet customer demand.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Redundancy of data.</h5><p>It would be considered one of the important aspect of any software that is, data redundancy. The data that is to be maintained and stored in database should not have redundancy. If it has redundant data it would lead to data inconsistency</p></li>
        <li><h5>Limited growth.</h5><p>The market for an offline business is usually limited. For example, a restaurant's clientele may live within a 10-mile radius, which could restrict the owner's growth opportunities. Several traditional business ventures, such as bookstores and video rental stores, have become unprofitable  because they cannot compete with the low-cost structure of their online counterparts.</p></li>
